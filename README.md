lucid_cm
========

`lucid_cm` provides basic interfaces to the Campaign Monitor API including
authentication, lists etc. Each interface is designed for extension and
provides only a base from which to start.

It is designed around my own workflows and experiences and is not intended to
cover every possible scenario. It is also unstable and subject to change as I
figure out the details.


Examples
--------

### Authentication

Authentication is handled by `LucidCM::Authenticate`.
